Moving overlapped rectangle required a bit of thinking, drawing using graphics was a bit confusing at the beginning but easy once I got it. Rest was alright.

What I modified:
(1) I added a "Delete all" button on the top right, connection it with the "clear all" function.
(2) On the left from "Delete All", I added the "Delete" button which deletes the shapes that was selected.
(3) Added a "Move" Button on top right, when user select shapes and click the "Move" button, the user will be able to move shapes using keyboard'a arrow key.
(4) Added the "Moving Text" option, texts and also be scaled up and down, as well as change colour by changing the "Fill Colour".

Run the program by running the main file (A1)

Thank you!
